PORT=8080
```[2]

## Running the Environment

1. Launch the container using Docker[6]

2. Access the interface through any of these options:
- Main interface: http://localhost:8080
- Desktop view: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
- VNC connection: localhost:5900[6]

## Best Practices

**Security Considerations**
- Run in a virtual machine or container for safety
- Avoid providing login credentials
- Use sandboxed environments for testing[4]

**Performance Optimization**
- Keep screen resolutions at 1280Ã—800 or lower
- Use keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse movements
- Start with simple, well-defined tasks[5]

## Technical Capabilities

The Computer Use feature allows Claude to:
- Control cursor movement
- Execute keyboard commands
- Take screenshots
- Interact with applications
- Run terminal commands[5]

For optimal results, provide clear instructions and break down complex tasks into smaller steps. The system uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model to interpret and execute commands through a virtual environment[7].
